# Ristorante conFusion

### My React Course Project


#### About
This is a React/Redux application for a fictional restaurant, Ristorante con Fusion. This is part of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology's React course on Coursera.org.

#### Features
React, Redux, Thunk

#### What I Learned
This was my first time ever developing a React application! Though it was difficult at first, I enjoyed the challenge of learning how to structure components and link them together. The code for this project was also a great reference for building the foundation of my own personal application.
